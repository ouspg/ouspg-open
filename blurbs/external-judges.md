# Letter for the potential external judges

Good morning,

We would appreciate a bit of help with our summer of hacking.

In the spirit of the Google summer of code we had three groups
of summer trainees working on practical security topics for
three months.

Our summer trainees would appreciate if you could spend
~30 minutes as an external judge.

Development was extremely repository centric and open
and tools like Docker were heavily used to make results
easily approachable for everybody.

Links to the projects of the groups are listed below,
each of them has a top level README.md that
you could review.

Group A (2 people)

* <https://github.com/ouspg/trytls/>
  * Does ​your​ library check TLS certificates properly?

Group B (1.5 people)

* <https://github.com/ouspg/libfuzzerfication/>
  * fuzzing for the rest of us!

Group C (1 person)

* <https://github.com/ouspg/honeypots/>
  * Packaking a honeypot for small communities
* <https://github.com/ouspg/urlhandlers/>
  * Discover and Hack URL handlers

Please pick your favorite group and reply to this email
to allow us to count the votes. Optionally please
give any feedback to the any of the projects.
We know it would be well received.

Furthermore we would like to mention
your name as one of the judges of the summer
of hacking documentation in the OUSPG open
top level README.md at:

<https://github.com/ouspg/ouspg-open/>

* So which group is your favorite?
* Any feedback to the group(s)?

We are going to announce the results to the
trainees on their last day of work on Tuesday
30th of August. We can't affort any grand prizes
for them beyond feedback and fame so
your feedback would be of immense value.
If possible, please reply before next Tuesday.

Thank you very much!

/All of us @ OUSPG
