Dear Mr. Halderman,

I am writing to get some advice related to the TLS protocol. I'm not entirely sure whether I am contacting the right person, so if that's not the case I would like some help with that. However, I would like to present something you, NSRG and possibly the international DROWN Attack team might be interested in.

We at the Oulu University Secure Programming Group (OUSPG) have been working on TryTLS, a tool for the software and library developers, vulnerability researchers, and end-users, who want to use TLS safely. Our GitHub repository and detailed information can be found at https://github.com/ouspg/trytls.

We have several backends for tests, BadSSL and SSLLabs to name a couple (see https://github.com/ouspg/trytls/tree/master/backends for the full list), but there are always more ways to exploit the certificate checking.

University of Michigan has been involved in some very interesting TLS related research, namely a multitude of attacks (POODLE, DROWN, Weak Diffie-Hellman & Logjam, Heartbleed, FREAK). We would really value your input if you could think of some good backends, tests or other resources that you think would be useful for this effort.

Keep up the good work,

Mauri Miettinen
