Dear Mr. Halderman,

I am writing to get some advice related to the TLS protocol. University of Michigan has been involved in some very interesting TLS related research, namely a multitude of attacks (POODLE, DROWN, Weak Diffie-Hellman & Logjam, Heartbleed, FREAK).

I'm not entirely sure whether I am contacting the right person, so if that's not the case I would like some help with that. However, I would like to present something you, NSRG and possibly the international Drown Attack team might be interested in.

We at the Oulu University Secure Programming Group (OUSPG) have been working on TryTLS, a tool for the software and library developers, vulnerability researchers, and end-users, who want to use TLS safely. Our GitHub repository and detailed information can be found at https://github.com/ouspg/trytls.

We have several backends for tests, BadSSl and SSLLabs to name a couple (see https://github.com/ouspg/trytls/tree/master/backends for the full list), but there are always more ways to exploit the certificate checking. Hence, we would like some pointers on more tests or to what direction we should take this. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Mauri Miettinen, research trainee at OUSPG
