## Title

Python-based TLS tester tool

## Content

We at Oulu University Secure Programming Group, OUSPG for short, have been developing a neat little gadget called TryTLS. It is a systematic tester tool that checks the safety of TLS libraries. We think we have something of value here, as certificate handling is a very complex and overlooked issue!

The tool and info on how to get started can be found here: https://github.com/ouspg/trytls (fun fact: @mamietti is me)

### for python

Thought you guys might be interested in Python being used in security research context. There's some stubs written in Python as well, so there is existing info about vulnerabilities which might come in handy.

### netsec+infosecuthing

We would really value your input if you could think of some good backends, tests or other resources that would be useful for this effort. There are also many existing examples and results to look through, and see if it will come handy in the future.
