# What is OUSPG

The purpose of the Oulu University Secure Programming Group (OUSPG) is to study, evaluate and develop methods of
implementing and testing application and system software in order to prevent, discover and eliminate implementation level security vulnerabilities in a pro-active fashion. Our focus is on implementation level security issues and software security testing.


# OUSPG Timeline

 * 1996 - OUSPG was born
 * 1998 - First [buzz on the bug](http://sunsite.uakom.sk/sunworldonline/swol-08-1998/swol-08-emailbug.html) - Issues on Outlook Express and Netscape Communicator on various platforms
 * 1999 - PROTOS Research starts - the era of systematic black box testing begins
 * 2002 - PROTOS-spinoff [Codenomicon Oy](http://www.codenomicon.com/) is founded
 * 2002 - [PROTOS SNMPv1](https://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/ouspg/PROTOS_Test-Suite_c06-snmpv1) test material reveals issues in [hundreds of products](http://www.cert.org/historical/advisories/CA-2002-03.cfm#vendors)
 * 2004 - [PROTOS Protocol Genome project](https://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/ouspg/genome/) taking the testing from another planet to another universe
 * 2006 - FRONTIER-spinoff [Clarified Networks Oy](https://www.clarifiednetworks.com/) is founded
 * 2006 - Clarified Networks crew wins [VMware ultimate virtual challenge](http://www.vmware.com/mena/company/news/releases/uvac_winners) ($100 000)
 * 2007 - Genome project starts to yield [tons of results](https://github.com/aoh/radamsa#some-known-results)
 * 2011 - [Aki Helin](https://github.com/aoh) and [Atte Kettunen](https://youtu.be/RScnahkajKw) collect [tons of bug bounties](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/hall-of-fame) over the following years. Billions of online users secured.
 * 2015 - Codenomicon finds the [Heartbleed Bug](http://heartbleed.com/) from OpenSSL
   * affected about 2/3 of the WWW-servers on the Internet
   * also SSL-VPNs, network appliances and wide variety of client-side software

# Impact

 * Practical research outcomes:
  * The security testing of the popular browsers have proactively improved the security of the software tens of millions of users use every day
  * The early research prototypes revealed vulnerabilities in the products from hundreds of network equipment and software vendors

 * Spin-offs:
  * Giving back to the taxpayers: spin-offs employed up to hundred security specialists in years 2012-2015 in Finland.  
  * Proactive security: commercialized fuzzers have proactively improved the security of our critical infrastructure: telecommunication, healthcare, car industry, finance, and others
  * Incident handling: A number of countries have moved from purely manual incident reporting to fully automatic, allowing up to 600 times better coverage in their countries

# Publications

* Publications:
 * [PROTOS publications](https://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/ouspg/Protos)  in the areas of:
   * proactive elimination of software vulnerabilities, using model-based fuzzing, and
   * vulnerability coordination.
 * [PROTOS Genome publications](https://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/ouspg/genome) in the area of model assisted fuzzing.
 * [FRONTIER COMPAT publications](https://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/ouspg/Frontier-Compat) in the area of analysing the security of complex information networks and systems.
 * [PROTOS-MATINE publications](https://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/ouspg/PROTOS-MATINE) identify critical components and dependencies by combining different information sources (system specific and public, technical as well as social information sources) and visualizing the results
 * [FRONTIER RIDAC publications](https://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/ouspg/RIDAC/Publications) in the area of Open Source RFID Audit Framework

# Life after OUSPG

Over 74 people have worked for OUSPG over the course of 20 years.
It has been the stepping-stone for many careers which have influenced on how the
 world looks at security and tech in general.

 * Co-founder of an international thought-leader company, making security testing
   a standard practice, not only in IT, but also medical, automotive, industry
   control systems and other

 * Co-founders of another though-leader company, impacting on how many nations
  approach national cyber security

 * Employees targeted by the head-hunters of world-famous companies, such as
   Google and Microsoft

 * A cyber defender in a senior specialist role at a national cyber security centre - also advising other nations.

 * International man of mystery living in US. Charms with his curly hair and has helped the biggest telcos, as well as their network equipment vendors, to improve the resiliency and security readiness of their networks. He drives Audi, carries a laptop on his left hand, green card in his back pocket, and breaks everything he connects to.
