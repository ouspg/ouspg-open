 * There was a Sauna excursion from 18:00 to 20:00 @ [Oulun Sauna](http://www.oulunsauna.fi). The Sauna was excellent, a swim in the river was relaxing, our company was enjoyable and weather was smiling at us. :)

### Tue 2016-06-21 @ Tellus Innovation Arena, Linnanmaa Campus (12:00-17:00)

 * Back at the *Square - Teamwork Area* at the [Tellus Innovation Arena](http://www.oulu.fi/tellusarena/).
 * Latest news from and brainstorming with the [libfuzzerfication](https://github.com/ouspg/libfuzzerfication/) team:
  * Team reduces [`ouspg/libfuzzer-base`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ouspg/libfuzzer-base/) docker image size radically.
  * Ossi Herrala (@oherrala) conducts rocket science experiments in applying libfuzzer to Haskell.
  * Pauli Huttunen (@WhiteEyeDoll) officially joins as a salaried insurgent and draws up ambitious plans to scale ("vertically") from a stub to a cloud scale fuzzing of that target.
  * Plans to scale ("horizontally") from a stub to a horde of stubs for the myriad of libraries, parsers and decoders out there. We need to help developers directly to achieve this.
 * Frenzy of coding and scripting with the [TryTLS](https://github.com/ouspg/trytls/) team:
  * Team writes test (driver) stub experiments with Python and Lua.
  * [BadSSL](https://badssl.com) is studied further and used as the initial backend for the test stubs.
  * Codification of the TryTLS backend prototype proceeds.
 * We did a dive into security audits with help of [Katakri](http://formin.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=328713&contentlan=2&culture=en-US):
  * We used [Aapo audit](https://github.com/ouspg/aapo-audit) as a case study.
  * Battle hardened auditors Mikko Kenttälä (@Turmi0) and Mika Seppänen (@mseppanen) of [Synopsys](http://www.codenomicon.com/) visited us to workshop with us and walk us through Katakri in practice.
  * Aapo project team was represented by Laura Saukko, Kaarlo Määttä, Matti Suuronen and Ari Vaulo of University of Oulu and Hannu-Pekka Heinäjärvi of [Futurice](http://futurice.com).
 * Kasper Kyllönen (@nkapu) wraps up the [honeypot push](https://github.com/ouspg/honeypots). Docker packaged [Cowrie](https://github.com/micheloosterhof/cowrie) ended up small and neat compared to our few years old Kippo iteration. Work was done in 76 man hours out of 60 originally allocated, not bad at all. :)
 * G-BOA (Grand bearded OUSPG Alumni) Erno Kuusela of [Solita](http://www.solita.fi), Ari Kauppi (@kauppi) of Ericsson, Jesse Hulkko (jhulkko) and Jani Huhtala (zaux) with [Kapsi](https://www.kapsi.fi) hat drop in and share ideas and help all the teams and day's topics.

### Tue 2016-06-14 @ Tellus Innovation Arena, Linnanmaa Campus (12:00-17:00)

 * Our first time at the [Tellus Innovation Arena](http://www.oulu.fi/tellusarena/), testing out the *Square - Teamwork Area*, worked out well.
 * Jani Kenttälä (@janike) and Marko Laakso (@ikisusi) have a initial kick off meeting with the current [Aapo](http://www.oulu.fi/yliopisto/node/37547) project team about an educational security audit. We plan to take two hackathon type sessions during the summer on auditing Aapo in open and educational fashion with help from invited external experts.
 * Group planning around our summer social "startups" [libfuzzerfication](https://github.com/ouspg/libfuzzerfication/) and trytls [TryTLS](https://github.com/ouspg/trytls/). Fresh brains to pick were most welcome.
  * Both teams presented their plans.
  * First libfuzzerfied stubs appeared.
  * TryTLS received expert consultation from Ossi Herrala on SSL/TLS/X.509/DH/CA quirks.
  * Competition was announced. Team with more contributors to their repo at the end of the summer wins.
 * Jani Kenttälä (@janikenttala) and Joachim Viide (@jviide) (re)join OUSPG staff as hired guns for our summer of the hacking :)
 * Kasper Kyllönen (@nkapu) is half-way through his first 2 weeks sprint with us. First sprint is about updating the foundations for a affiliated Kippo-honeypot community. Updated instructions will be available in a [public repository](https://github.com/ouspg/honeypots/).
 * Ossi Herrala (@oherrala) has a counseling meeting with Christian Wieser (@chwieser) on [Ossi's B.Sc. thesis](https://github.com/ouspg/secudep/blob/master/thesis/thesis.pdf) on [Secure Deployment in Challenging Environments](https://github.com/ouspg/secudep/). Ossi's wrap-up: "Implementation progressing. Experiments to be done. Writing almost halfway done. Draft 0 to be delivered to prof next week."
