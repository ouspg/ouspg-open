 * Coming up, welcome!
 * Pauli Huttunen (@WhiteEyeDoll) came to wonder how many clustered virtualization platforms could one person learn about, break and fix in a single summer.
 * Heikki Vesa visited to network. Heikki has long running and interesting hobbies ranging from lock picking, reverse engineering to building honeypots. Linked Heikki with Tarlab and @turmio.
 * Timo Lintonen and Kimmo (hash) Halonen from VTT meet to discuss opportunities for mathematician interested in security and potential thesis topic. Thanks to Kimmo for visiting and consultation!
 * Jani Yli-Kantola and Harri Hirvonsalo from M3S research group visit to discuss research around how people gain more control over their personal data (MyData) and to brainstorm on the TLS/SSL certificate check checking.

 Exercises.
 * Engaged Pekka Tetri (@Theasolon) (OP-Pohjola Group) with his Ph.D. on [Information Security: Panacea becoming a malady?](https://github.com/ouspg/secmalady/) Still missing a technical experiment/tool to analyze the complexity added by the add-on-security, if any. Needs help there.
 * Engaged Ilkka Sovanto (@Wraithh) (NCSC-FI) on his M.Sc. thesis about [a testbench/rack of various published and proposed algorithms and tools to extract evil from network events](https://github.com/ouspg/pahuus/).
