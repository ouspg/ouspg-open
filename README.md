## Something for the future

* What we learned from (insanely) repo-centric workflow

## June - August 2016: Weekly phun & terror filled this space

OUSPG Open 2016 is now closed. We would like to thank contributors,
participants, and anyone who was mentioned in this journal. (We hope we
didn't forget anyone!) Encounters and
interactions were one of the best things for us this summer!

As of 2016-08-3, it has been almost 3 months since we
[started](https://youtu.be/YYGVykWtk2s). Since that a lot has happened.
[honeypots](http://github.com/ouspg/honeypots) project was completed,
with smaller image size than the closest alternative,
[urlhandlers](https://github.com/ouspg/urlhandlers) took a leap in research
and [awareness](https://github.com/ouspg/urlhandlers/blob/master/doc/tracking.md).
[libfuzzerfication](https://github.com/ouspg/libfuzzerfication) simplified
fuzzing, and [TryTLS](https://github.com/ouspg/trytls) has already
started making impact to the security of programming languages.

### Tue 2016-08-30 Minimum Viable Award Gala @ Tellus Stage, Linnanmaa Campus (12:00-17:00)

[![Gala](img/open-close.jpg)](http://slides.com/evilon/ouspg-open-2016#/)

* Jani Tuovila (@replicant2020) from Bittium
* Anna-Maija Juuso from Oulu University visited us afterwards to hear how the
  summer went.

### Tue 2016-08-23 @ All Over Oulu

This Tuesday, we enjoyed the company of five different companies in
Oulu. As we went on, we tried to hijack people from previous
company to the next with some success.

* [Synopsys](http://www.synopsys.com/software/Pages/default.aspx)
  * Antti Kiiveri introduced Synopsys in general and Teemu Vaskivuo
   (@tevas) presented AbuseSA. We learned that Synopsys has a number
   of openings today, and more are coming up for different topics.
  * Matti Kamunen talked about Defensics, and finally
  * Sampo Niittyviita entertained us with his bachelor thesis.
    presentation dealing with [ISTQB](http://www.istqb.org/) testing.
    We found familiar ground reflecting Sampo's work trough
    security audits.
* Checked out the new [Kielo](http://kielo.com/) premises and met
  with one of their residents, [Radai](http://radai.fi/).
  * Jarkko Ruottinen explained the idea of Kielo, Christian Wieser from Radai
    showecased fancy drones, used for everything else except photography.
* [F-Secure](https://www.f-secure.com)
  * Sami Hyvönen presented F-Secure in general and Samu Sarivaara
    presented Rapid Detection service. We were glad to see F-Secure
    has grown in Oulu, and is eager to grow some more. They are also hiring!
  * We also met [Atte Kettunen](https://youtu.be/RScnahkajKw) (@attekett) first
    time with his new hat on (he moved from OUSPG to F-Secure)
* [Prove](https://prove.fi/) - last but not least! We were
    inspired by CEO, Antti Niittyviita.
  * Prove indeed is a very successful company, probably due to all
    the hard work with the feet on the ground.
  * Antti recommended Simon Senek's TEDx-talk
    [How great leaders inspire action](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action).
  * He shared with us Prove's ups and downs. It Proved to be very
    good session, as we discovered the [truth](thetruth.png)

### Tue 2016-08-16 @ Tellus Innovation Arena, Linnanmaa Campus (12:00-17:00)

* [TryTLS](https://github.org/ouspg/trytls) and
  [Libfuzzerfication](https://github.org/ouspg/libfuzzerfication) popularisation
  plans revisited. Going after more challenging, but more important audience
  education-wise, e.g. the developers instead of security pros.
* Recap from [URL Handlers](https://github.com/ouspg/urlhandlers/) crew about
  [what we learned](https://github.com/ouspg/urlhandlers/blob/master/doc/whatwelearned.md)
  from [Assembly](http://www.assembly.org/summer16) popularsation efforts
* Petteri Parhi from OP stopped by and talked about kaenkky.com early
  popularisation efforts. kaenkky.com was the "restaurant app" of Oulu
  in early 2000.
* The great TryTLS shootout - took official Docker images of different Linux
  distributions and ran TryTLS for as many languages as possible. Results are
  at [TryTLS repository](https://github.com/ouspg/trytls/tree/master/shootout)
* Inspired by other popularisation efforts, especially [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/)

### Tue 2016-07-12 @ Tellus Innovation Arena, Linnanmaa Campus (12:00-17:00)

* Strangely attracted to the *Frost Club* at the the [Tellus Innovation Arena](http://www.oulu.fi/tellusarena/).
* [TryTLS](https://github.com/ouspg/trytls/) team starts with hands-on training
  to easily test whether *your* favourite library checks certificates properly.
  TryTLS stubs were started:
* [How to write TryTLS Stubs training](https://youtu.be/85EO61l2Oa4) given
  by Mauri Miettinen (@vaulthunter)

    TryTLS team in 2.5 hours :)
* [libfuzzerfication](https://github.com/ouspg/libfuzzerfication/) follows up
  with hands-on training on easy libfuzzer testing.
  * [Howto write libfuzzerfication stubs](http://remarkjs.com/remarkise?url=https://github.com/ouspg/libfuzzerfication/blob/master/doc/stub_writing.md#1)
    by Mikko Yliniemi (@mikessu)
  * `mysamplelib` - a demonstration stub against simple artificial target
    by Marko Laakso (@ikisusi)
  * we learned that a stub takes a bit over 2.5 hours to write if the
    target's build is not already familiar
* Jani Tuovila (@replicant2020) from Bittium and Antero Metso dropped in as
  well, unfortunately without their laptops this time.
* There was a Sauna excursion from 18:00 to 20:00 @
  [Oulun Sauna](http://www.oulunsauna.fi). The Sauna was excellent,
  a swim in the river was relaxing, our company was enjoyable and weather
  was smiling at us. :)

### Tue 2016-07-05 @ Tellus Innovation Arena, Linnanmaa Campus (12:00-17:00)

* It was a rainy and stormy day and there as a very big screen. :)

  exotic platforms, fuzzing engines, speed and other drugs. :)
* Location was the [*Ice Breaker Stage*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E768QZKgDWw)
  at the [Tellus Innovation Arena](http://www.oulu.fi/tellusarena/).
* Impressive 22 fuzzing experts from OUSPG, Synopsys, NCSC-FI, F-Secure, Solita,
  Ericsson and Bittium participated.
* Plenty of hands on activity, people **brought their laptops**!
* Agenda:
  * Collaborative ~~30~~ 90 minutes on the State of Art in fuzzing via shared
    [Etherpad](https://e.kapsi.fi/p/fuzzsota) on Kapsi's infra (Everyone)
    * see [the fun of making it video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrhRUKgeDQI)
    * see [the resulting whipepaper](presentations/fuzzing-sota.md)
  * *Fuzzing with Docker* by Atte Kettunen (OUSPG)
  * *libfuzzer* by libfuzzerfication team (OUSPG)
  * *Fuzzing beyond C* by Ossi Herrala (Synopsys) ([slides](http://remarkjs.com/remarkise?url=https://github.com/ouspg/libfuzzerfication/blob/master/doc/oherrala-fuzzing-beyond-c.md))
  * Competitive coding to familiarize ourselves with the idea of
    [fuzzing stubs](https://github.com/ouspg/libfuzzerfication) to bring
      fuzzing closer to development (Everyone)
* Thank you all!

### Tue 2016-06-21 @ Tellus Innovation Arena, Linnanmaa Campus (12:00-17:00)

* Back at the *Square - Teamwork Area* at the [Tellus Innovation Arena](http://www.oulu.fi/tellusarena/).
* Latest news from and brainstorming with the
  [libfuzzerfication](https://github.com/ouspg/libfuzzerfication/) team:
  * Team reduces [`ouspg/libfuzzer-base`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ouspg/libfuzzer-base/)
    docker image size radically.
  * Ossi Herrala (@oherrala) conducts rocket science experiments in applying
    libfuzzer to Haskell.
  * Pauli Huttunen (@WhiteEyeDoll) officially joins as a salaried insurgent
    and draws up ambitious plans to scale ("vertically") from a stub to a
    cloud scale fuzzing of that target.
  * Plans to scale ("horizontally") from a stub to a horde of stubs for the
    myriad of libraries, parsers and decoders out there. We need to help
    developers directly to achieve this.
* Frenzy of coding and scripting with the
  [TryTLS](https://github.com/ouspg/trytls/) team:
  * Team writes test (driver) stub experiments with Python and Lua.
  * [BadSSL](https://badssl.com) is studied further and used as the initial
    backend for the test stubs.
  * Codification of the TryTLS backend prototype proceeds.
* We did a dive into security audits with help of [Katakri](http://formin.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=328713&contentlan=2&culture=en-US):
  * We used [Aapo audit](https://github.com/ouspg/aapo-audit) as a case study.
  * Battle hardened auditors Mikko Kenttälä (@Turmi0) and
    Mika Seppänen (@mseppanen) of [Synopsys](http://www.codenomicon.com/)
    visited us to workshop with us and walk us through Katakri in practice.
  * Aapo project team was represented by Laura Saukko, Kaarlo Määttä,
    Matti Suuronen and Ari Vaulo of University of Oulu and Hannu-Pekka
    Heinäjärvi of [Futurice](http://futurice.com).
* Kasper Kyllönen (@nkapu) wraps up the
  [honeypot push](https://github.com/ouspg/honeypots). Docker packaged
  [Cowrie](https://github.com/micheloosterhof/cowrie) ended up small and neat
  compared to our few years old Kippo iteration. Work was done in 76 man
  hours out of 60 originally allocated, not bad at all. :)
* G-BOA (Grand bearded OUSPG Alumni) Erno Kuusela of
  [Solita](http://www.solita.fi), Ari Kauppi (@kauppi) of Ericsson,
  Jesse Hulkko (jhulkko) and Jani Huhtala (zaux) with [Kapsi](https://www.kapsi.fi)
  hat drop in and share ideas and help all the teams and day's topics.

### Tue 2016-06-14 @ Tellus Innovation Arena, Linnanmaa Campus (12:00-17:00)

  testing out the *Square - Teamwork Area*, worked out well.
* Jani Kenttälä (@janike) and Marko Laakso (@ikisusi) have a initial kick off
  meeting with the current [Aapo](http://www.oulu.fi/yliopisto/node/37547) project
  team about an educational security audit. We plan to take two hackathon type
  sessions during the summer on auditing Aapo in open and educational fashion
  with help from invited external experts.
* Group planning around our summer social "startups"
  [libfuzzerfication](https://github.com/ouspg/libfuzzerfication/)
  and trytls [TryTLS](https://github.com/ouspg/trytls/). Fresh brains
  to pick were most welcome.
  * Both teams presented their plans.
  * First libfuzzerfied stubs appeared.
  * TryTLS received expert consultation from Ossi Herrala on
    SSL/TLS/X.509/DH/CA quirks.
  * Competition was announced. Team with more contributors to their repo
    at the end of the summer wins.
* Jani Kenttälä (@janikenttala) and Joachim Viide (@jviide) (re)join OUSPG
  staff as hired guns for our summer of the hacking :)
* Kasper Kyllönen (@nkapu) is half-way through his first 2 weeks sprint with us.
  First sprint is about updating the foundations for a affiliated Kippo-honeypot
  community. Updated instructions will be available in a [public repository](https://github.com/ouspg/honeypots/).
* Ossi Herrala (@oherrala) has a counseling meeting with Christian Wieser
  (@chwieser) on [Ossi's B.Sc. thesis](https://github.com/ouspg/secudep/blob/master/thesis/thesis.pdf)
  on [Secure Deployment in Challenging Environments](https://github.com/ouspg/secudep/).
  Ossi's wrap-up: "Implementation progressing. Experiments to be done.
  Writing almost halfway done. Draft 0 to be delivered to prof next week."
